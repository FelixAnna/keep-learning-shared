## Seven Core Competencies/Values of Business Agility

- <hint>Alignnment</hint>
- <hint>Build-in Quality：flow， pair and peer, collective, automation, DoD</hint>
- <hint>Transparency</hint>
- <hint>Respect for people ad culture</hint>
- <hint>Relentless Improvement</hint>
- <hint>Program execution</hint>
## Alignment

 A clear strategy communicated across the organization, aligned objectives, and a shared understanding of how to best work together help organizations remain aligned to thrive in a fast-changing world.
 
 for teams to understand the <blue>current state of business</blue>, <blue>the goals</blue>, <blue>how everyone should move together to archive those goals</blue>, but does not imply to command top-down command or control

## Buid-in Quality

* Establish flow
* pairing and peer review
* Collective ownership and standards
* Automation
* Defination of Done


## Transparency

Working transparently

Being transparent means being open about the <blue>progress, risks, and mistakes</blue> we made at work. We must <blue>not obscure or hide data or opinions</blue>. 
Only when we share and hear transparently can we solve problems and create great solutions. 
This openness can only be achieved in an environment of <blue>trust</blue>, where teams and the business can <blue>confidently rely on each other</blue> in times of difficulty.

    not obscure means: should clearly express and not hide 

## Respect for People

- Respect your people(as it is basic human need), 
- Value diversity of people and opinions.
- Grow people through coaching and mentoring.
- Embrace ‘your customer is whoever consumes your work.’ 
- Build long-term partnerships based on mutual benefit

Hold precious what it is to be human. 
    This is the literal meaning of ‘respect for people’ described in Lean. Elaborated further, it means fostering a <blue>corporate culture</blue> that ```enhances individual creativity and values teamwork``` while <blue>honoring mutual trust and respect</blue> [4].

Value diversity of people and opinions.
    Another way to show respect is to build organizations that include people with various personal and professional backgrounds. However, just hiring a diverse workforce is insufficient. Respect for people requires <blue>listening to and valuing perspectives and viewpoints</blue> different from our own.
 
Grow people through coaching and mentoring.
   Respect for people goes beyond a fundamental moral obligation. The practical business implication is that ‘it is necessary to develop good people in order to make good products.’ One way to <blue>help people grow</blue> is to facilitate connections with others inside and outside the organization who can <blue>contribute to each person’s development journey</blue>.
   
Embrace ‘your customer is whoever consumes your work.’ 
    Lean and Agile methods are <blue>customer-centric</blue>, as both recognize that customers are the ultimate beneficiaries of value. In addition, Lean explicitly addresses the fact that all who consume your work, including people inside the organization, are customers too. ```Treating customers with respect and empathy``` produces products and services that <blue>address their real problems</blue>.

Build long-term partnerships based on mutual benefit. 
    Many suppliers are required when building the world’s most complex systems. When applied to suppliers, respect means holding them in the same high regard as customers, challenging them, and helping them improve. This is done not by bullying or pressuring tactics but by <blue>creating long-term relationships defined by ‘win-win’ contracts</blue> based on mutual benefit and accountability.
## Relentless Improvement 

The relentless pursuit of perfection has always been one of the core tenets of Lean. While unattainable, striving for perfection leads to continuous improvements to products and services. In the process, companies have created more and better products for less money and with happier customers, leading to higher revenues and greater profitability. But improvement requires learning. Rarely are the causes and solutions for problems that organizations face clear and easily identified. ```Relentless improvement is built on a series of small iterative and incremental improvements and experiments that enable the organization to learn its way to the most promising answer to a problem```. The following moves can help build a culture of relentless improvement in a SAFe enterprise: 

### Create a constant sense of urgency. 
    
<blue>Improvement </blue> are essential to the **survival** of an organization and <blue>should be given priority, visibility, and resources</blue>. They require an intense focus on delivering value to customers by providing products and services that solve their problems in a preferred way over the organization’s competitors. Organizations that become complacent and fail to relentlessly improve with urgency risk losing customers and may ultimately go out of business.

### Build a problem-solving culture. 

Problem-solving is the driver for relentless improvement. It <blue>recognizes that a gap exists</blue> between the current and desired states, <blue>requiring an iterative process to achieve the target state</blue>. Iterative Plan-Do-Check-Adjust (PDCA) cycles provide the process for iterative problem-solving on small adjustments as well as breakthrough innovations. The goal is to have <blue>a culture of ‘everyone improving all the time.’ </blue>

### Reflect and adapt frequently. 

It’s vital in SAFe to <blue>periodically pause from the never-ending backlog</blue> of new work to openly <blue>identify and address shortcomings of the process</blue> at all levels. Improvements should be <blue>managed and prioritized just like any other story</blue> or feature because improvement requires real work and consumes real capacity of teams and trains, as well as for those who guide the portfolio processes. 

### Let facts guide improvements. 

Improvements based on opinion or conjecture will likely focus on symptoms instead of <blue>true root causes</blue>. Improvement results are objectively measured, focusing on <blue>empirical evidence</blue>. This helps an organization concentrate <blue>more on the work needed to solve problems and less on assigning blame</blue> or on pursuing improvements that are not solving the original problem. 

### Provide time and space for innovation. 

Improvements should be <blue>designed to increase the effectiveness of the entire system</blue> that produces the sustainable flow of value instead of optimizing individual teams, silos, or subsystems. Everyone at all levels should embrace improvement thinking, but improvements in one area, team, or domain should not be made to the detriment of the overall system. SAFe Principle #2 Apply systems thinking expands on this idea further.

## Program exection

Program execution is teams, teams of teams, systems, and services <blue>working together to address these complex challenges</blue> to deliver customer value. 


## Mindset
* Value, 
* Respect for people and  Culture, 
* flow: establish a continuous flow of work for value delivery based on constant feedback and adjustment
    understand the full way the customer use the solution
    visualization and limit the work in progress, so no if you have enough work in progress.
    reduce batch size (a small piece/batch of work)
    managing work item queue length
    Eliminating waste and removing delays
* <blue>innovation</blue>: really understand customer, find increative ways to solve the needs/problem
* relentless improvement: optimal process, reinforce promble solving mindset, reflect at key milestones to openly identify and address prcocess shortcomings at all level.

## 10 principles (SAFe Lean-Agile Principles)

### take an economic view

<blue>delivery early and often</blue> against take too long to delivery, also can <blue>get feedback earlier</blue>;
apply an economic framework, even SAFe team is self-organized, they make small and large decision every day,  and result in decentralized decisions, but may not economic

### system thinking

<blue>high level understanding</blue> of behavior and architecture

```optimizing a component does not optimize the system```

a system can ```evolve no faster than its slowest integration point```

the value of a system pass throught it interconnections

### Assume variability and preserve options
requirement and design must have flexibility, as no one can possibly know everything at the start

```flexible requirement and multiple design options```

### Buid incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles

```the iteration cycle result in fast feedback and fast learning```

### Base milestones on objective evalution of working system

PI system demos are orchestrated to deliver objective process/product, objective milestones facilitate learning and allow for continuous, cost-effective adjustment towards an optimum solution

### Make Value Flow without Interruptions

```Visualize and limit WIP, reduce batch size and manage queue length（Address bottlenecks```

Work in process. There is always some work in process in the system; if there weren’t, there could be no flow of value. Bottlenecks. In every flow system, one or more bottlenecks effectively limit the flow through the entire system. Handoffs. Handoffs wouldn’t be necessary if one person could do all the work. But in any material flow system, different individuals and teams will have different skills and responsibilities. Each plays its part in moving a work item through the system. Feedback. Customer and stakeholder feedback is integral to efficient and effective outcomes. Ideally, feedback happens throughout the entire process. Batch. As any system has a finite capacity, all the work can’t be done at once. Therefore, work through the system occurs in batches designed to be as efficient as possible. Queue. It all starts with a set of work items to be done. In addition, each value stream needs a prioritizing mechanism to sequence the work for the best value. Worker. People do the critical work of moving work items from one state to another. Policies. Policies are integral to flow. They may be local policies — like team-based policies that determine how a work item moves from step to step — or global policies like those that govern how work is performed within the company.

### Apply Cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
Aligning Development Cadence
Synchronize with Cross-Domain Planning

### Principle #8 – Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
Workers themselves are most qualified to make decisions about how to perform their work The workers must be heard and respected for management to lead effectively Knowledge workers must <blue>manage themselves and require autonomy</blue> Continuing innovation must be part of the work, the tasks, and the responsibilities of knowledge workers

### Principle #9 – Decentralize decision-making
Delivering value in the shortest sustainable lead time requires decentralized decision-making, which is a critical tenet of Lean thinking. Any decision that must be escalated to higher levels of authority introduces a delay. Also, escalated decisions can decrease quality due to the lack of local context, plus changes to the facts that occur during the waiting period. Conversely, decentralizing decision-making <blue>reduces delays, improves product development flow and throughput, and facilitates faster feedback and more innovative solutions</blue>. Higher levels of empowerment are an additional, tangible benefit.

### Principle #10 – Organize around value
Build technology portfolios of development value streams Realize value streams with product-focused Agile Release Trains (ARTs) Form Agile teams that can directly deliver value

## Essential SAFe

## Role

### product owner
define stories and prioritize team backlog
### Servant leader and agile team coach


## System Demo
after the completion of every PI, provided a integrated, comprehensive view of the new features delivered by the ART.
## Inspect & Adapt
a set of improved backlog items that go into the program backlog for the next PI planing event
## PI planing 
8-12 weeks, 4 development iteration + 1 innovation and planning iteration (IP iteration)

## IP iteration
Acts as an estimating buffer for meeting PI Objectives, provides dedicated time for innovation, continuous education, PI planing and other events 

## Art Sync

### Scrum of Scrums
RTE or scrum masters meet every week to <blue>review their progress towards milestones</blue>, <blue>PI objectives</blue> and <blue>dependencies</blue> among the team
### PO sync
facilitated by RTE or Product Manager, to <blue>get visibility into the ART progressing</blue> toward meeting the program increment objectives

## iteration
iteration planning -> execution & daily standup -> iteration review -> retrospectrive

backlog refinement: takes 1-2 in every iteration, team refines reviews and estimate item in backlog


## Large Solution SAFe
it contains everything in essential safe, also introduce
### Solution Train
multiple agile release trains

### Capacbilities
describe high-level solution behavior and can split into mutiple features and can span across multiple ARTs

### Solution Backlog
hold upcoming capabilities and Enablers

### others in Large Solution SAFe
Solution Epics/ Non-functional requirement / Enablers Capabilities

### Role
Supplier is internal or external org who develop and deliver component / sub-systems who help solution train deliver solutions to customers

## Portfolio

### Value Stream
a sequence of activities needed to convert business into digitally enabled solution (feature -> define -> build -> validate -> release -> new increment of value)

## Lean Portfolio Management

### SAFe Portfolio
a collection of development value streams.
Portfolio Canvas is a template to identify specific SAFe portfolio, it defines the domain of the protfolio and other key elements

Identity opportunities for the portfolio's future state with SWOT(strength/weaknesses/opportunities/threats) and TOWS use divergent and convergent thinking
Evaluate your options and select a future state
identify the epics(business / enabler) that will get you to the future state
