## Architecture Fundamentals

**Resource groups**:  a logical container to deploy and manage resources.

**Subscriptions**: group together user account and resources created by those users, manage costs, have resource limits or quotas.

**Management groups**: up to 6 level, manage policy, access, compliance for multiple subscriptions.

**Region**: geographical area with one or multiple datacenters.

**Availability zone**：made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

**Region pairs**： 2 regions within the same geography at least 300 miles away

1. isolated from regional disasters

2. If an extensive Azure outage occurs, one region out of every pair is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quickly as possible
3. Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time
4. Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for **Brazil South**) for tax- and law-enforcement jurisdiction purposes.

**Resource Manager template**: a JSON file that defines what you want to deploy to Azure

**Invoice sections**: a line item on the invoice that shows the charges incurred that month for selected multiple subscriptions.
