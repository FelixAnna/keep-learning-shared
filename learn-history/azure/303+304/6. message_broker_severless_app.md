# Severless app, Message & event

## azure functions: 
a key component of serverless computing, run a piece of code without provision and scale infrastructures. need host in a function app, event-driven (need a trigger), auto-scale, better to be stateless, but need to execute within 5 minutes(2.5 minutes for http trigger), peak in executions( not continously).

## function app: 
logically group and structure functions and compute resources, **Consumption service plan**(auto scaling, dispose with default timeout 5 minutes, up to 10 minutes), **Azure App Service plan**(make sure function run continously), function app must link to **an storage account**(logging function executions, managing execution triggers and code&config file:for Consumption service plan only).
	
## Function: 
**Bindings** + **functions**, Bindings: input like trigger, output like cosmos, when call a function, provide code=XX in url or x-function-key in header, Monitor can check call history.

## Logic App: 
another serverless component, trigger(push/pulling trigger) + condition(if-else, switch, foreach, until loop) + action(send email/function/...)

## Message Queue
**Azure Storage Queue**, **Azure Service Bus**

## Event Hub
**Azure Event Grid**, **Azure Event Hub**

## Message versus Event
message contains **more raw data**, sender almost **expect reciver processing** the message in a certain way (actions for sender and reciever make up an intergrated operation), often work for distributed service integration.

events are **lighter than message**, often used to **broadcast** communications, use **pub-sub architecture**. often not care how subscriber deal with the event, just publish to topic. sometimes need group a few event as transaction, can have 0~* reciever.

	Does the sending component expect the communication to be processed in a particular way by the destination component?
	yes: message, no: can also use event

## Azure Storage Queue
part of Azure Storage, need Azure storage account, can store large num of messages (80G+),  can be securely accessed by Rest-based interface (or client libary), (80G+ space, 2000 messages/second thoughput, support audit trail and check prcocess progress), message in queue by defaut not auto delete, 64kb message.
	
## Azure Service Bus Namespace
manage keys, pricing tier, can access by using client libary,256kb message(standard), 1 mb message(premium tier).

### Azure Service Bus Queues
a message broker for enterprise applications, higher security requirements/multiple communication protocols/different data contracts, have default lock duration 30 seconds.

### Azure Service Bus Topics
like Service bus queue, but have multiple subscribers(interal use queues for every subscriber).

## Benefit of queues
increased **reliability**, message **delivery guarantees**(At-Least-Once, At-Most-Once, FIFO),**Transactional** support.

## Event grid
a **fully-managed** event routing service runs on top of service Fabric distribute events from different sources to different hanlders, **easier solution** to build event based applications on Azure. Support many azure and on-premise services, it provide a **dynamically scalling**, **low-cost**, messaging system.  we have system topics, we can subscriber to the topic or custom defined topics. Pay-per-event.
	
## Event Hubs
like event grids, but **optimized for high thoughput**, **larger number of publishers**, **security (authenticaion) and resiliency**. support message partition, capture (persistence)

	Event Hubs:
		Basic, Standard, and Dedicated tier
		Consumer group can helps multiple apps process event indenpendently. event can be published individually or in batches, all cannot exceed 1mb, partition: expected number of concurrent cunsumers, from 2-32, default is 4., message retention from 1-7, default is 7.
		
## Azure Relay
without changing port, network, we can connect both applications to a same Azure relay to make sure they can communicate (code level change after we setup relay sevice with hybrid connections), support HTTP/WebSocket, use Hybrid connections by default
