# Storage

## Data Classify
### Structured data
	relational data stored in relational database,  -- Azure SQL Database
### Semi-structured data
	no-relational data or nosql like document, key-value, graphic, etc. format as xml/json/yaml/...  -- Azure Cosmos DB
### Unstructed data 
	media files, text, binary, log, etc. -- Azure Storage Account (Blob, files, queues, tables)
		
## ACID

### Atomicity 
	either all of the work is done, or none of it is.
### Consistency
	ensures that the data is consistent both before and after the transaction.
### Isolation
	ensures that one transaction is not impacted by another transaction.
### Durability
	means that the changes made due to the transaction are permanently saved in the system. 
			
## OLTP/OLAP
Online transactional/analytical processing

### OLTP
	more users, quick response, high availablility handle small or relatively simple transaction
### OLAP
	less user, longer response times, less available, hanlde large and complex transactions.

## Azure Storage Account
A container that groups a set of azure storage services together: Blob, Files, Table, Queue.

### Settings
	Vnet, 
	Secure transfer required (check or uncheck), 
	Access Tier( only for blobs, hot-quicker access but expensive, cool, cold, archive), 
	Location,
	Replication: 
		LRS, 
		ZRS (zone redundant storage), 
		GRS(geo-graphic-redundant storage), 
		RA-GRS (often provide read access for secondary region, implement circuit breaker, default option)
	Performance: 
		Standard(use magnetic disk drive), 
		Premium(support append blobs, block blobs, premium file shares, and use SSD- solid state driver)

	We can have different storage account.

### Deployment model
	Resource Manager - have latest API for create/manage storage resouces, classic: legacy API not recommand.

### Account Kind
	StorageV2 the latest one. BlobStroage, StorageV1 ...

### WindowsAzure.Storage
	access and manage storage in code. conn by connecting string with full access.

## Azure Storage Explorer
A GUI tool can connect to multiple storage acc and manage them(upload and do some check or queries).
Also can connect to Cosmos DB and Data Lake
Support setup local emulators for save cost in develop stage.

### Blob
		Block blobs: for media files, images, read from begin to end.
		Page blobs: random access, primary used for VHDs.
		Append blobs: made of many block blobs, optimized for append.

### Secure
		data written to storage is automatically encrypted;
		Firewalls and Virtual Networks:
			enable https only access;
			open access to vnet or ip address range only;
		cors;
		Role-based access control(need Azure AD enabled);
		Shared access signature: with self-defined limit access;
		Advanced Threat Protection: detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit storage accounts.
### Azure Files
		storing and share files used by application, or act as VM share drive, or used by on-premises app.
		Performance: Standard or Premium performance
### Disk
		OS disk: for OS.
		Data disk: we can add one or more.
		Temporary disk: each vm have one.
		Performance: 
			Ultra SSD: 
				fastest,high IOPS, low latency (only for vm in availablity zone, in a subnet, used as data disk) 
				up to 160000 IOPS, 2000 MBps Throughput, 64T disk

			Premium SSD V2:
				80000 IOPS, 1200 MBps, 64T
			
			Premuim SSD: 
				high performance,ensures performance, 
				up to 20000 IOPS, 900 MBps Throughput, 32T disk
				7500IPOS, 250 Throughput 2T
				performance figures are guaranteed

			Standard SSD: 
				high performance,not guarantee performance
				up to 6000 IOPS, 750 MBps Throughput, 32T disk
				500IPOS, 60 Throughput 2T
				Not guaranteed

			Standard HHD: 
				Slow cheap, 
				up to 6000 IPOS, 500 MBps Throughput, 32T disk 500IPOS, 60 Throughput 2T
				Not guaranteed
			
### Monitor
		enable minute metrics,
		enable logging,
		use azure portal storage account 
			-> metrics or storage explorer to check and troubleshoot.
