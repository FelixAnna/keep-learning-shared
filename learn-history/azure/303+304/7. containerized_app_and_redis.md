# Containerized Service in Azure(PaaS), Redis

## Docker
 Dockerfile, Docker Registry, Docker Image, Docker Container
### Dockerfile:
    FROM: download base image and create a new container base on it;
    WORKDIR: set the current working directory;
    COPY: copy files or folders from host computer to the container;
    RUN: execute a command in the container;
    EXPOSE: container will open a port for communication;
    ENTRYPOINT: container will run the command when it start;
    CMD: command triggers while we launch the image.

### Container Registry
     like Docker Hub, is a private repo, support build from Dockerfile by Container Registry Tasks, Support CI.
#### Container Registry Tasks
        for CI, need configure web hook at code repo side(like github) and then use command to configure Tasks on ACR side, or use DevOps tools to automated the process (az acr task create --registry registryName --name taskName --image imageName --context reposUrl --branch master --file Dockerfile --git-access-token <access_token>)
#### authentication 
    support AAD and admin account authentication, is a private repo
#### geo-replication
    premium SKU only
#### Command
    az acr create --name regName --sku standard/premium/basic --admin-enabled true --resource-group mygroup
    docker login reName.azurecr.io
    az acr repository list --name acrName --output table
    az acr update -n acrName --admin-enabled true
    az acr replication create --registry acrName --location eastus
### Container Instance:
    load docker image and run with scalibility
    Support mount Azure Storgae Files shares to retrive and persit data;
    Fast startup compare to VM
    Incur cost when the container is running(no cost when terminated)
    Command:
        az container create --name containerName --image XXX --ports 80 ...
    Restart Policy:
        Always: for long-running tasks like web servers.(restart when stopped)
        Never: Container runs one time only;(when stopped then terminated)
        OnFailure: when the process have non-zero exit code, then terminated.

    Environment variables:
        az container create ... --environment-variables KEY=VALUE Key2=Value2
    Secure Environment vairables: similar, but value will not displaying in output.
    Mount File share:
        az container create ... 
            --azure-file-volume-account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
            --azure-file-volume-account-key $STORAGE_KEY \
            --azure-file-volume-share-name aci-share-demo \
            --azure-file-volume-mount-path /aci/logs/
    Troubleshoot:
        logs: get logs for the container's running application(az container logs --name containerName ...)
        attach: get container setup logs (az container attach --name containerName ...)
        exec: execute a command in container directly (az container exec --name containerName --exec-command /bin/sh)
        metrics: monitor cpu and memory usage of a container (az container metrics list --resource containerId --metric CPUUsage --output table)
## Docker Command:
    docker pull repositoryUrl:tag (default: lastest)
    docker image list
    docke run -p outPort:innerPort -d imageName (-d means start in background)
    docker ps
    docker stop containerNames
    docker rm containerNames
    docker container rm -f containerName (force remove a running container)
    docker image rm imangeName

    docker build -t imageName:tag . (use Azure Container Registry Tasks to build docker image base on current directory from a file named Dockerfile, or use -f to give a different docker file name)
## App Service:
    fully managed PaaS web app hosting platform, 
    Deployment Slots: can have multiple for different environments(prod, dev,uat), can easily swap or re-arrange accordingly(ex: increase prod slot percent and reduce dev when test finished)
    CI/CD: for all popular repo + visual studio (+ images from cr like acr or docker hub, then enable  continuous development from Container Settings page in app service), support automatically or manually.
    Auto scale: scale up/down(cpu, memory), scale out(machine instances)
    OS: Linux , Windows (easy to enable application insights without code changes)

### WebJobs
    scripts, applications which can run together with app service within the same app service plan. Can run continuous or triggered at configured time. development, deployment together with app service(for .net, we can on app service project right click add WebJobs, for others, we can also add a job from app service portal).
        SDK: Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs + Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions
        Connection strings: WebJobs dashboard connection string for save it current status + previous execution details, Storage Account Connection String for connect to a storage account and read/write data if needed.
        JobHost: configured in main, for listen to trigger events and call functions.
        function: a procedure executes in response to a trigger event.
        bindings: to avoid hardcode input and output details in your functions.(in a function.json file)
## Container
    immutable: once build can deploy and run with same behaviour in different env;
    lightweight: not like vm have os, it only have applications rely on the host OS for kernal specific services.
    fast startup: startup in seconds not like VM might be minutes.
## AKS
    Kubernetes: a portable, extensible, open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling and the management of containerized workloads.
            
### AKS
    support automatic OS updates, self-healing and easy scaling; k8s master is managed by Azure and is free, have agent node, only pay for VMs on which your nodes run.can use resource management templetes for deployment.

    Support Standard Kubernetes tools, development and management tools like Helm(Template, Chart)

    Azure Dev Spaces: helps local dev team to work with AKS.

    Deployment Center: help setup CI/CD, monitor(Application Insights), enable Azure monitor for containers to monitior the container workload on AKS.

    Azure Service Integration: integrate azure service like storage account, vpc, AAD.

    Auto Scaling: scale pods amount + scale node amount

## Azure Cache for Redis
    support transaction(ensure multiple message queue and then send together)

    Transaction: just ensure they queued together, but not ensure they all executed successfully.
    Expiration: set cached data with optional expiration settings
    EViction Policy(maxmemory-policy in Advanced Settings): no-eviction/allkeys-lru (least recent used)/allkeys-random/volatile-lru(least recent used with expiration setting)/volatile-ttl(keys with shortest time to live with expiration setting)/volatile-random
    Cache-aside pattern: 
        read: read from cache first, if null read from db and set cache; 
        update: invalid cache before update database.
    Priming: load cache at startup for some data.
    Consistency: know the inconsistency possibility for data in cache might be update by other app without the current scope.
    Command: az redis create --name redisName --vm-size c0 --sku Basic ...
    MULTI/EXEC/DISCARD/EXPIRE/...
