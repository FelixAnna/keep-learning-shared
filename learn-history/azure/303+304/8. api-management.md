# API Management

Azure API Gateway is an instance of Azure API Management service we need create.

## Features
 Import: by Open API json file (or url), or through function app, logic app, API in app service, or even manually create one;

**Multiple API version**: we can import multiple version and switch to a certain version in API gateway;

Assembly: we can connect to one of many APIs as a single modern interface;

Monitoring: we can see error responses and log files and filter by response type;

Analytics: we can see the histrory of API calls and system who called them;

Security: support integrate with OAuth2.0, AAD, support public or private (need key to call API) or certififated protected API,

and support change url(url **rewrite**)/header/body by **inbound/outbound** policies in operation/API/product/global level;
    
## Pricing
    besides Basic/Standard/Premium tier, we can also user developer and Consumption tier.
    Developer: no scale units;
    Basic: 2 scale units, 1000 requests/sec, 99.9% SLA;
    Standard: 4 scale units, 2500 requests/sec, 99.9% SLA;
    Premium: Multi region deployment, 99.95% SLA, 4000 requests/sec, 10 scale units per region;
    Consumption: pay for what we use, dont have dedicated resource, setup in seconds, built-in high-availability, auto-scaling.
    
## Product 
    a collection of APIs, which can have product level policies and subscription keys, so you can provide API for different purpose.
    
## Subscription Key: 
    have 2 subscription keys (primary and secondary) for ALL API(global in an API gateway) by defaults, we can also create for product/single API level (single API may have multiple operations like GET, POST, DELETE), when an API/Product enabled subscription required option, we need either provide the key in header:Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key or in query: subscription-key
    
## Policy:
can execute in different times: Inbound/Outbound/Backend/On-Error, can edit from design panel.
    
Policy Examples: 
 **limit rate/ limit rate by key / cache response / filter ip address/ allowed cross region resource sharing 
        / mock response / JWT validation / url rewrite / body or header rewrite or check 
        / transformation/ authentication related / ...**

scope: **global in gateway, product, API, operation level**

order: depend on <base /> on front or behind the defined policy

client certificate policy: for consumption tier, enable Client Certificates from "Custom domains" first, then configure the policy in API/Product/Gateway level

## API Management Consumption tier + Function APP
     built-in auto scaling, high-availability, work togther is cheaper if we dont have continuous stable or high workloads.
