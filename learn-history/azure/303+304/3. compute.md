# Compute Service

## vm
To host our applications, more control to the osï¼ŒIaaS

	availability set: two or more logical VMs with dedicated power and network (fault domain), 
	physical server, hardware, 
	to keep our applications available during planned or unplanned maintenance.

	vm scale set: we can centrally manage, config and update a large number of vms 
	to provide an high availability applications, 
	we can let it scale on demand, mannually, or base on a schedule.

	azure batch: with azure batch accounts, we can config a pool of compute vms, 
	then create job within the pool, and then config applications and staging data, 
	watch or wait for the job finish(the vm in pool will auto scale down), 
	and then check the results.
	
## container
run on host OS, bundle needed libaries to run applications in a container(process) in the host OS. 
		
## vms versus containers
	 container don't use viualization, so it more lightweight than vms, 
	 container are secured and isolated and we can run multiple containers in a VM.
		
## Azure container instances(ACI)
an auto simplicity container service that we can upload our containers and execute(PaaS)

No orchestration, serverless
		
## Azure kubernetes service(AKS)
complete orchestration service for containers with distributed architecture with multiple containers, 
support horizontal pods scale, and vertical nodes scale. 
(often works with ACR, azure container registry)
	
## app service
PaaS, we can select our lanaguage and other settings, 
deploy our code (API, web, mobile backend, azure jobs) to the platform, 
azure will run our applications and scale as needed on the platform (up to 50).
	
## serverless computing
deploy code and run with scalability (Functions: for code, or Logical Apps: for workflow and build from predefined logic blocks)

	Abstraction of Servers: no infrastructure for maintain (no way and no need to maintain VMs),
	Event-driven scale: a function contains code, trigger(Http, queues, timers, etc), and bindings. 
	platform schedule the function to run and automatically scale according to the rate of coming events.

## Provisioning solution
### Custom Scripts 
	download and run scripts on virtual machines. (bash/powershell)
### Desired State Configuration(DSC)
	support more complex install procedure like reboot. (powershell)
### Chef
	 manage many nodes (or VMs) , either vm or on-premise at a time. {3rd party}
### Terraform
	 create deploy templates for many cloud provide. (HCL: hashicorp configuration lanaguage) {3rd party}
### Azure Resource Manager templates
	 json file that define the resource we want to provision.
### Azure automation state configuration
	 work with DSC, to track DSC progress and status and ensure all target machines are config as expected.

### Resource Manager templates:
	define all resources for a deployment, we can deploy that to a resource group.
	parameters:	specify which values are configurable before we run the template, such as password. 
	variables: define values used throughout the template, make template easy to maintain.
	functions: define procedures we can repeatly used in the function.
	resources: define azure resources who make up the deployment.
	outputs: define desired output while template runs.
	create from:
		https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/templates/
		export from resource group -> Export template
		start from begining

## VM templates (image) or VHD templates (image):
	For generate custom vm images with preconfigured version of an os.
	how to generate VM images:
		prepare or reset: reset hostname, user and credentials, security identifiers for different service. (Sysprep or waagent) in admin mode (sudo waagent -deprovision+user)
		logout or exit
		deallocate: az vm deallocate --resource-group <resource group> --name <virtual machine name>
		generalize: az vm generalize --resource-group <resource group> --name <virtual machine name>
		Capture from overview page(Azure portal) 
			or az image create --name <image name> 
				--resource-group <resource group> 
				--source <generalized virtual machine>
		done.
		 then we can create new VM from the generalized image.		
	an vm image contains an image of every VHD in the vm. we can also create VHD snapshot in a easy way, stop the vm, the capture a VHD snapshot.

## VM scale set
	allow us deploy many load-balanced, identical VMs, with auto scale up and down support 
	(Autoscalinng or metrics-based scaling, scheduled-based scaling, manual).
	Horizontal scaling: add or remove vm.
	Vertical scaling: add or remove memory, CPU, disk space.
	can use custom scripts extensions to update machines in the scale set.
## Windows Virtual Desktop
	provide customized os and software environment for remote workers.
## Automate our business processes
### Design first
	Logic Apps: a service we can use to automate, orchestrate, 
		and integrate disparate components of a distributed application. 
		can design or write less code. 
		have many connectors we can communicate to external service (like twitter..), also support define customer connector.
	Microsoft Power Automate: create workflow, like logic app, but not support coding.
### Code first
	Azure Functions: code as a service, auto-scale, mirco-bill(no use no pay), 
		support many trigger.
	Azure WebJobs: if need work with app services, more control over the JobHost.
## High performance computing - HPC
### Azure Batch
	 with the support of batch account, we can create auto scale batch pool 
	 (with many batch tasks work as a batch job in the pool) 
	 to working with large-scale parallel and computationally intensive tasks. 
	 (also have some packages we can use, like 3D Max, pay for the time we used)
	 (Batch Explorer can monitor batch job status)
### HPC VMs
	 H-series/ G-series / HB-series / HC-series / N-series / NC-series / ND-series VMs, 
	 batch can allocate those VMs,if we cannot found them, 
	 we may need ask Azure to support that first 
	 (or make sure they are available in the selected region).
### HPC Pack
	allow batch runs on cloud and on-premise HPC instances.

### VM size
	Hxxx: farest CPU, high-thoughput network, HPC, support RDMA.
	Nxxx: GPU optimized, for graphic/video/model trainning for deep learning.
	Lvs2: Storage optimized, high throughput/ipos, great for nosql, and large transactional db;
	Gxxx: Memory + Storage optimized VMs.(32u+512G)
	Exxx/MXX: Memory optimized, greate for sql db, cache, in-memory analytics;
	Fxxx: compute optimized, High CPU-to-memory ratio, meduim traffic web/application
	Bxxx or Dxxx: general purpose, for testing, development, small traffic web/application
	Dxx: Optimal CUP-to-memory configution, can run most of production workloads. 
		(consider a little weak then Hxxx series)
	Bxx: burstable, can scale up/down without resizing.

### VM boot diagnostics
	Not support premium or zone redundant storage account, aslo need in same region
	(for address issues when a vm enters a non-bootable state)
