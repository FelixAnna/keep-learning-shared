psychological safety:

a team culture, ensure that every members was heard, members practiced empathy (synergize: 
combine or coordinate the activity of (two or more agents) to produce a joint effect greater than the sum of their separate effects.), 

be accessibe (availible for small talk)
acknowledge you own fallibility (not pretending to be perfect, build a more authentic relationship)
embrace the messangers (dont shoot or react negatively to messangers)
celebrate failures as learning(think how can we use the experience to improve)

Team building (build relationship, trust) activities + game + lunch etc.

align on goal
leverage strengths (acknowledge and take advantage of motivated employee with different skills or abilities)
Foster innovation (team members participate and contribute in design sprint or innovation and planning sprint)
Remove barries (team leader continuously remove any barries for team, to keep team on peace)
Address invevitable conflict ( leave time for team members migrate conflict (2 days etc), but if not resolved, we need sit together with them and find a synergise way)
Hold teams accountable as a unit ( collective ownership, team members always count success and failure together instead of individual's)

celebrate and reflect (find what is good and what can be improved, celebrate milestones, award on pizza or food, etc.)
