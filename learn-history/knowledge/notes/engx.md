## Code Quality:
	- Standards, Scan, Security, Performance
## Unit Test:
	- Maintainability, doc, better design
## Code Review:
	- Share knowledge, Code quality, Enforce standards, security/compliance
## Knowledge Sharing:

	- Stable Team, Documented Standards, Smooth Onboarding
	
	Test pyramid:
		User Interface/End-to-End/Acceptance Tests
		Integration/API/Component Tests
		UT
		
	Unit Test:
		FIRST principles.
		- Fast
		- Independent
		- Repeatable
		- Self-Validating
		- Timely (write before or at the same time)
		Benifit:
		- keep the maintainability high.
		- A better understanding of component functionality
		- improve the code’s design by compelling developers to create testable components

## Technical Debt
Best Practices for Managing Technical Debt
	Measure technical debt (e.g., code smells) using static code analysis tools.
	Regularly allocate time to address technical debt found by static code analysis (e.g., every sprint, every several sprints).
	Track intentional technical debt (reasoned architecture and development shortcuts to meet project deadlines).
	Estimate your intentional technical debt.
	Regularly allocate time to reduce intentional technical debt.

## Branching Strategies
Best Practices for Version Control Systems and Branching Strategies
	All teams should understand how to select the best version control strategy for their project.
	Teams should prioritize developing a branching strategy based on the project’s VCS.
	The branching strategy and related decisions should be documented in a knowledge management system.
