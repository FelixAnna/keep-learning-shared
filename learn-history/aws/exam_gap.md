## X-Ray
    help identify performance issues and errors.

    trace user requests through entire application,
    pinpoint which application cause performance issue,
    
    X-Ray service map let you see relationship between your application and resource in real time.
## 504 Gateway Timeout
    means your web server didn't receive a timely response from another server upstream


## gp3 SSD volumes
    IOPS governed by volume size,  more IOPS then gp2
## gp2 SSD volumes
    IOPS governed by volume size,  3000 IPOS / TB: 1TB-3000, 3TB-9000, with 16000 maxinum IPOS - 5.34TB

## dynamoDB streams
    captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table and stores it in a log for up to 24 hours
## Tags
    Principle Tags & resource tags can be used to control access to resources.

        ## Dms
            Can not migrates data as a source(can be a target)

## cross region copy
    EBS and RDS support cross-region snapshot
## Deticate host with host affinity:

    When affinity is set to Host, an instance launched onto a specific host always restarts on the same host if stopped. 


## NAT
    NAT-Gateway can not be used through VPC peering

## Aws privatelink


## volumes
    You can now increase volume size, adjust performance, or change the volume type while the volume is in use. You can continue to use your application while the change takes effect


## route53 health check
    HTTP and HTTPS health checks â€“ Route 53 must be able to establish a TCP connection with the endpoint:
        within four seconds. 
    In addition, the endpoint must respond:
        with an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx within two seconds after connecting. 
    After a Route 53 health checker receives the HTTP status code, it must receive the response body from the endpoint:
        within the next two seconds. 
    Route 53 searches the response body for a string that you specify. The string must:
        appear entirely in the first 5,120 bytes of the response body 
    or the endpoint fails the health check

## Aurora storage auto scale
    Aurora storage scales automatically and yet is cost effective because you are billed for what you use.

## Amazon Connect / Lex
    Amazon connect to setup contact center for inbound/outbound calls

    Amazon Lex to build voice/text chatbots

## EC2 
    a recoved instance is identical to the original instance (ip/instanceID/metadata).

## ACL for web server subnet
    inbound for port 80
    outbound traffic will be going through the ephimeral port range (1024 - 65535)
## SMS Connector
    only supprt VM for now.
## CloudEndure
    support migrate physical servers
## AD one-way trust
    not support SSO
