# Security

## KMS
    a regional service to manage data encryption keys (generate, import, manage, rotation)

    rotation: new key for encryption, old key still for decryption.

    Customer Managed Key (CMK) is a logical representation of a key. Keys can be generated by KMS or imported. (CMK have one or many backing keys for encryption/decryption)

    key stores by hardware security modules and never levels KMS.

    all logs to the keys are logged to cloudtrail.
    using FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs

## CloudHSM
    hardware security module, dedicated private HSM runs within/outside your VPC, access only to you, no HA (include 2+ for HA).
    using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs 

    now can also managed by KMS cutomer key store.
    
## ACM - Certicate Manager
    manage certificate, can create and renew cert, can import cert.
    Integrate with ELB, API Gateway, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFront;
    free,
    integrate with Route53 to perform DNS checks.
    Regional service,
    use KMS to encrypt/decrypt private key and send to service(ELB...)
    (key never stored persistent on any service, only encrypted version, use KMS to decrypt)

## WAF
    Web Application Firewall, use WebACL consist of rule based access conrol to allow or block traffic, WAF include AWS shield standard also.
    Protect CloudFront, Application LB, API Gateway, AppSync API

## Shield
    protect resource from DDoS attack (standard, advanced), 
    Layer 3/4 level protect

## GuardDuty
    A security monitoring service, Use machine learning to identify unexpected or potentially unauthorized and malicious activities in your AWS environment.
    GuardDuty analysis VPC logs, DNS logs, CloudTrail management events, CloudTrail Event Logs, CloudTrail s3 data event to archieve the goal.

    you can find the findings in GuardDuty console, or through CloudWath events.
